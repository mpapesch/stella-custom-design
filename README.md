# Readme

This repository provides a custom design to be used with [Stella(R)
Archtiect](https://iseesystems.com/store/products/stella-architect.aspx).

This custom design makes use of favorite fonts and colors aiming to appear
plain and simple. The layout for slides is based on a 1920x1080 resolution with
a margin and a 3x3 grid layout that aims to maintain a 16:9 ratio for media.
One goal is to provide a coherent appearance for  multiple model interfaces.

It provides prepared pages for repeating use-cases such as 'Title', 'Problem
Statement & Reference Mode', or 'Interactive Interface'. The design is supposed
to grow as additional use-cases are encountered.


# Usage

specified in the Preferences Dialog and clone this repository.
